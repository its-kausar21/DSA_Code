//focus on next pointer.If we want to delete a particular node then we must take nodes next pointers value to current node.
Copy the value of the next node to the current node.
Update the next pointer of the current node to skip over the next node by pointing it to the next node's next.

class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        node.val=node.next.val;
        node.next=node.next.next;
    }
}
